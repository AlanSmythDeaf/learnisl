## UX

When I decied to an online quiz, had many different options but decided to go with learn Irish Sign Langaguge(ISL), this is a basic quiz just to learn ISL.

### Colour Scheme

The main color in the back that I decided to use is

- `#faebd7` used for primary text in index page.
- `#000000` used for primary text in game page.

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

### Typography

I use the font Verdana as it's it score highly for web accessibility, I kept that one font throughout the website


## User Stories

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to easily understand where to go and how to play the quiz.
- As a new site user, I would like to ____________, so that I can ____________.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to do the quiz easily over and over again and hopefully get 10 out of 10.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to create a layout of the website in the planning idea for the website. I had create a wireframe for each page in mobile, tablet and desktop.

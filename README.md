## UX

When I decied to an online quiz, had many different options but decided to go with learn Irish Sign Langaguge(ISL), this is a basic quiz just to learn ISL.

### Colour Scheme

The main color in the back that I decided to use is

- `#005677` used for background colour of all the pages.
- `#FAEBD7` used for inside quiz game page.
- `#FFFFFF` used for primary text.
- `#000000` used for for buttons and for how to play page.

The reason I chose blue is that, it represent the Deaf Community and I ensure that black text has white background so that it's viviewing accessibility.

### Typography

I use the font Verdana as it's it score highly for web accessibility, I kept that one font throughout the website

## User Stories

### New Site Users

- As a new site user, I would like to easily understand where to go and how to play the quiz.
- As a new site user, I would like to easily play the quiz.

### Returning Site Users

- As a returning site user, I would like to do the quiz easily over and over again and hopefully get 10 out of 10.

## Wireframes

Balsamiq was used to create a layout of the website in the planning idea for the website. I had create a wireframe for each page in mobile, tablet and desktop.

### Mobile Wireframes

## Features

The quiz website has three pages, Index/Home page, Game page, How to play page.

The website is an online quiz, the questions are images and have four answer, when you chose an correct answer the sweet alert will pop up and say well done and an wrong answer pop will be hard luck. At the end of the quiz you will get a score result i.e You scored 3 our of 10! with time countdown left.

The quiz has a timer count down, if you failed to complete the quiz before the countdown you will get an alert saying game over and it will bring you back to home page
### Existing Features

| **Image for ISL** | **Title for feature #2**|
| ------------- | ------------- |
| ![screenshot](assets/images/isla.png) | ![screenshot](documentation/welldone.png)  | 
| - This feature is an image that is use for the questions, without using the images as question the quiz wouldnt use at all | - The feature of this is that giving an pop up alert is telling user that they are either correct or wrong, which I think it's useful|

### Future Features

- More Questions
    - I would include 26 alphabet and increase the number of questions
- Options
    - I would include different options to learn ISL - basic words &  numbers & alphabet & Sentence
- Video
    - Would add a video as a question, Person signing sentence and try to figure out what the person said
